        // Remarks:
        //      A segmentation engine may examine the value of the IPlaceholderTagProperties.TextEquivalent

        // Summary:

        //     a segment.
        //
        // Remarks:
        //      Tags with this property should be treated similar to tags with "TagHandlingAlwaysInclude"
        //     in Filter Framework 1 and "placeholder" Trados tools.

        //     boundary.

        // Remarks:
        //      There should be no need for a segmentation engine to check the IPlaceholderTagProperties.TextEquivalent

        //     segments.

        // Summary:
        //     The tag will be included in a segment if the segment also contains text content,

        //     tags).

        //     The tag will be excluded from a segment, even if this means changing the
        //     segmentation. This is used for sub-content processing.
        //
        // Remarks:
        //     There are two circumstances where a tag with SegmentationHint set to Exclude
        //     will not be excluded from a segment; where the tag is inside a tag pair with
        //     SegmentationHint NOT set to Exclude or where the tag is inside a review marker.
